        <h1>Button Game v1.0</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This document outlines the functionality and design of the <strong>ButtonGamev1</strong> smart contract.
            The contract is designed to facilitate an onchain game to give away <strong>$DEGEN</strong>. The last player to press the button wins the pot.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>ButtonGamev1</strong> uses multiple onchain variables to determine the game state, game progress, and endgame handling. 
            All game variables are handled by the contract.  
            All gameplay is dependent on confirmed transactions.
        </p>

        <h2>Contract Variables</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>pot</strong>: Stores the current value of the game pot.<br>
            <strong>startBlock</strong>: Stores the block number when the game starts.<br>
            <strong>blockTarget</strong>: Stores the target block number to determine the end of the game.<br>
            <strong>lastBlockPlayed</strong>: Stores the block number when the last button press occurred.<br>
            <strong>freePlaysUsed</strong>: Tracks the number of free plays used.<br>
            <strong>numPlays</strong>: Tracks the total number of plays.<br>
            <strong>daoAddress</strong>: Stores the address of the DAO managing the contract.<br>
            <strong>currentWinner</strong>: Stores the address of the current game winner.<br>
            <strong>freePlayUsed</strong>: Tracks whether a player has used a free play.<br>
            <strong>endGameMet</strong>: Indicates whether the end game condition is met.<br>
            <strong>freePlaysEnabled</strong>: Indicates whether free plays are enabled.<br>
            <strong>playEnabled</strong>: Indicates whether the game is enabled.<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            <p>There are a few key values when it comes to ButtonGame.</p>
            <p><strong>1. The Pot: </strong>The current contract account balance. This will be transferred to the winner if the block target is reached.</p> 
            <p><strong>2. The Block Target: </strong>The block target is set based on the block number of the last confirmed button press. This means the block target is reset with each button press.</p> 
            <p><strong>3. The Current Winner: </strong>This is the current last player to press the button. If the block target is reached before another confirmed button press is recorded, this player will win the pot.</p>
